          <h3>Biography</h3>
          <p>
            I have been working in the web industry for 20 years. During my
            career, I have worked in various industries ranging from Radio to
            Healthcare and most recently, financial. I am always willing to
            expand my knowledge and experience. This year, I began my next
            journey, advancing my skillset into more full-stack development by
            taking a bootcamp course at the University of Minnesota.
